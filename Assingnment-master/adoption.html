        <h1>Request for adoption</h1>
        <p>
            Pet adoption is the process of taking responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or
            released to a shelter or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and
            rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model
            wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Online pet adoption sites have databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue
            groups, and are searchable by the public.
        </p>

        <h2>Adoption Process and Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            You're ready to adopt your new best friend. Great! Here are a few important things to know about our
            adoption process:
        </p>
        <ul class="requirement">
            <li>
                All adopters must be 18 years of age or older and must present valid/current government-issued
                identification at the time of adoption.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prior to adopting a dog or cat from Best Friends, adopters will need the knowledge and consent of their
                landlord.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before visiting either the Best Friends Lifesaving Center or NKLA Pet Adoption Center, save time and
                complete our adoption survey so when you visit our center the adoption process is already underway!
            </li>
            <li>
                Before going to a new home, each pet is vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and microchipped.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Here are some tips for making sure you hear back quickly:</h2>
            <ol class="requirement">
                <li>
                    Be sure to check the organization’s Petfinder home page to see if they
                    mention a delay due to the volume of inquiries they receive, family and
                    jobs, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read the pet’s profile carefully to be sure that she or he appears to be a match for your
                    lifestyle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep follow-up inquiries short, friendly, and to the point. A short
                    message will be read more quickly than a longer voice or email,
                    especially if the foster parent has only a short time in the evening to
                    check messages. Let the foster parent see you are the type of person
                    she really wants to adopt to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have reached someone with the group — even if it’s not your
                    pet’s foster home — ask him when you should expect a call back. In your
                    correspondence, let the group know you will be checking back again on a
                    particular date and time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for the foster parent’s name, even if it’s only a first name.
                    This will make future communication easier when you call back about
                    “Betsy, who is caring for Ruffian.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask if the group is holding any upcoming special events like a
                    meet-and-greet at your local Petco. Consider stopping by to meet someone
                    from the organization in person, even if your own special pet isn’t
                    scheduled to be there.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inquire about more than one pet and to more than one group. Even if
                    your heart is set on that “one special pet” you saw with a specific
                    group on Petfinder, check the pet lists of other groups, stop in at your
                    local shelter, and check out our Event Calendar to meet with other
                    rescue organizations. Bring a friend who might also be interested in
                    adopting. You’ll become a more informed adopter and your adoption
                    experience will be richer. Should you miss out on your “chosen one”
                    because he was adopted to another wonderful home, you are still moving
                    forward toward finding that special canine friend.
